      <h2>✨ Where It All Began</h2>
      <p>It was August 22, 2024 — a Thursday, around 6 PM. I had just come home from college, sitting in my little 1BHK room, feeling all alone. I found this app called Fondi on Instagram and downloaded it without thinking much.</p>
      <p>That’s when I met you. 🌟</p>
      <p>A message popped up: “Someone is joining in 5 minutes.” It was you — Jason. You said, “Hi Rachel, where are you from?” We spoke for nearly 4 hours. It was fun, warm, honest. You even said, “Your husband is paavam.” 😄 From that moment, you felt different. I never called you "Anna" even though you were older. Maybe that’s what fate had planned. 🌟</p>
    </div>

     <div id="popup2" class="popup">
      <button class="close-btn" onclick="hidePopup('popup2')">Close</button>
      <h2>🌤️ The First Weekend</h2>
      <p>The next day I waited the whole day just to talk to you again. You were at a marriage, but still ran to the rooftop just to talk. 📱 You shared stories and said you’d text me on Instagram before going to a movie. 🎬 We exchanged IDs — but you forgot mine! 😅 Eventually, we found each other again. Fondi, Instagram, Snapchat — all became our little home. 🏡 You even took me to “Algeria” in Fondi, your peaceful space. 🌍</p>
    </div>

    <div id="popup3" class="popup">
      <button class="close-btn" onclick="hidePopup('popup3')">Close</button>
      <h2>⚡ Our Fights & Firsts</h2>
      <p>We argued about photos, about video calls. 🙈 But those moments brought us closer. Even when I said I’d delete Fondi and Insta, you stayed. 🫂 You stood outside your sister’s college just to talk me out of it. 🎓 That day, we had our first real fight when I didn’t send my picture. Later, I did. The fights continued, so did the love. ❤️</p>
    </div>

    <div id="popup4" class="popup">
      <button class="close-btn" onclick="hidePopup('popup4')">Close</button>
      <h2>💞 Falling For You</h2>
      <p>Late-night calls, sleeping with the phone on — you became part of my day. 🌙📞 Studying, cooking, even cleaning — I felt your presence in everything. One day, I finally agreed to video call. It was just me on camera, rushing to college. 🎥 Later that day, I fell sick. But you stayed, comforted me, and made me feel safe. 🫶 That’s when I knew I could trust you fully.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="popup5" class="popup">
      <button class="close-btn" onclick="hidePopup('popup5')">Close</button>
      <h2>💬 Our Confession</h2>
      <p>We talked until 3 AM, 4 AM, sometimes even 6 AM. ⏰ One late night, you said those "Magical Words" and I said it back. 🥹 We never spoke about it again, but it stayed in my heart. 💖</p>
    </div>

    <div id="popup6" class="popup">
      <button class="close-btn" onclick="hidePopup('popup6')">Close</button>
      <h2>💔 The Hard Goodbyes</h2>
      <p>Another night, around 3 AM, you said you were leaving. 🕒 I cried until sunrise. That’s when we had our real video call — you in a blue shirt, hiding your smile. 😊 I was teary, swollen-eyed, but I saw your dimples and everything felt okay. I decided — it was you. You were the one. 🥲</p>
    </div>

    <div id="popup7" class="popup">
      <button class="close-btn" onclick="hidePopup('popup7')">Close</button>
      <h2>🌙 Quiet Drift</h2>
      <p>You were going to get married, and slowly, our calls became messages... and then silence. 📵 Still, I’d text you — because I missed you. Because I always will. You’re the only one who ever accepted me as I am. 🤍</p>
    </div>

      <h2>🌌 Final Words</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">
        You were the 🦨 butterfly in my dead garden.<br>
        Even if I can’t have you, I’m so deeply thankful I met you.<br>
        If I could meet you just once — even once in real life —<br>
        I know my soul would finally rest in peace. 🌙
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top: 20px; font-weight: bold;">
        With all my heart, always — Rachel 💖<br>
        Happy Married Life — I always want to see you with that cute big smile on your face. Please be happy man!
